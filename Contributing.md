# Contributing

## Overview

In order to contribute to any of our projects, you can raise an Issue or make a Pull Request. More on How to Raise Issues or make PR's later.

## How to begin

### If you are a Github Beginner

[Getting Started with Github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github)


### If you have prior experience of Github
You can have a look at our List of Projects, choose one of your liking and get a feel of the project by looking at the code or setting it up on your machine and playing around with it. You can then head to the issues tab and look for any of the existing issues that interest you and ask to take the issue for yourself. In case if someone is already working on that issue you ask them if they are still working on it or if they aren't able to work on that issue, you can take it up for yourself. Or you can raise an issue by yourself if you find any bugs or if you want to include a new feature in the project!

## Raising Issues
Simply go to the issues tab of the corresponding project you want to raise an issue in and go for it! We expect issues to be clear in what the issue is and what is and why the change should be made.

## Pull Requests
If you feel you can contribute in terms of code go ahead and open a PR. In a PR we expect you to be familiar with and follow with the project's coding patterns and commenting styles. If everything checks out your PR will be merged into the main project and then you'll have your contribution in terms of code!
